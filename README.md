# MovieWebScraper
A JS based web scraper using Node. Used the Cheerio(For Server Side jQuery) and Request Node Dependecies. A pretty fun task. 
Everything is done in the index.js file.

To Use:

- Install Node
- Clone project
- Navigate to project and type 'npm start'
- On the browser, go to 'localhost:3000/scrape'
- Look at the output file in the directory of the project, 'output.json', it should contain the scraped data.
